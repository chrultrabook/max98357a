MAX98357A Amp driver for Windows

Requires either Intel SST or CoolStar Audio

Tested on Skylake, Kaby Lake, Kaby-Lake-R and Ryzen

SST Note: This driver is only partially compatible with Skylake / Kabylake / Kaby-Lake-R as this uses "IntcAudioSSTMultiHwCodecAPI" which seems like it was special made for the Pixelbook to talk to Intel SST...
